# serialkillermuseum
This is a webscraping project I did during quarantine, when I started getting obsessed with the whole genre of murder mystery. Basically this website scrapes this [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_serial_killers_by_country), and sorting each serial killer's name based on the country they belong to. So, you can select a country and view the serial killers from that country. I did this project using BeautifulSoup for the web scraping part and to bring this website to life I used Flask as a web framework. </br>
